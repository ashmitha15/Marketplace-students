Description:
The project's objective is to develop a dynamic web application named "Marketplace," tailored specifically for students. It enables students to buy and sell various products and participate in university activities through clubs. Business owners can sell products to students and advertise within the college premises. School admins have control over the marketplace, allowing students and business owners to engage in transactions. A super admin manages the entire application, including admins, business owners, and students. The platform also includes a chat feature for communication between all participants. The goal is to provide a convenient and collaborative platform for student commerce and university engagement.
